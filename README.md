## Overview

This repository contains agents and environments described in the ICML'18
paper ["Synthesizing Programs for Images using Reinforced Adversarial Learning"](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/ganin18a.html).
For the time being, we are providing two simulators:
one based on [`libmypaint`](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint) and one
based on [`Fluid Paint`](https://github.com/dli/paint) (**NOTE:** our
implementation is written in `C++` whereas the original is in `javascript`).
Additionally, we supply a [Sonnet](https://github.com/deepmind/sonnet) module
for the unconditional agent as well as
[pre-trained model snapshots](https://tfhub.dev/s?q=spiral)
(9 agents from a single population for `libmypaint` and 1 agent for
`Fluid Paint`) available from [TF-Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub).

If you feel an immediate urge to dive into the code the most relevant files are:

| Path | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`spiral/agents/default.py`](spiral/agents/default.py) | The architecture of the agent |
| [`spiral/environments/libmypaint.py`](spiral/environments/libmypaint.py) | The `libmypaint`-based environment |
| [`spiral/environments/fluid.py`](spiral/environments/fluid.py) | The `Fluid Paint`-based environment |

## Quickstart with Docker

The easiest way to get SPIRAL up and running on your machine is to use a
pre-built [Docker image](https://github.com/ddtm/spiral-docker).

## Installation

This section describes how to build and install the package on Ubuntu (16.04 or
newer). The following instructions (with slight modifications) might also work
for other Linux distributions.

Clone this repository and fetch the external submodules:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/deepmind/spiral.git
cd spiral
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Install required packages:

```shell
apt-get install cmake pkg-config protobuf-compiler libprotoc-dev libjson-c-dev intltool libpython3-dev python3-pip
pip3 install six setuptools numpy scipy tensorflow==1.14 tensorflow-hub dm-sonnet==1.35
```

**WARNING:** Make sure that you have `cmake` **3.14** or later since we rely
on its capability to find `numpy` libraries. If your package manager doesn't
provide it follow the installation instructions from
[here](https://cmake.org/install/). You can check the version by
running `cmake --version `.

Finally, run the following command to install the SPIRAL package itself:

```shell
python3 setup.py develop --user
```

You will also need to obtain the brush files for the `libmypaint` environment
to work properly. These can be found
[here](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint-brushes). For example, you can
place them in `third_party` folder like this:

```shell
wget -c https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint-brushes/archive/v1.3.0.tar.gz -O - | tar -xz -C third_party
```

Finally, the `Fluid Paint` environment depends on the shaders from the original
`javascript` [implementation](https://github.com/dli/paint). You can obtain
them by running the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dli/paint third_party/paint
patch third_party/paint/shaders/setbristles.frag third_party/paint-setbristles.patch
```

Optionally, in order to be able to try out the package in the provided
`jupyter` [notebook](notebooks/spiral-demo.ipynb), youâ€™ll need to install
the following packages:

```shell
pip3 install matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage

For a basic example of how to use the package please follow
[this notebook](notebooks/spiral-demo.ipynb).

### Sampling from a pre-trained model

We provide [pre-trained models](https://tfhub.dev/s?q=spiral) for unconditional
19-step generation of [CelebA-HQ](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans)
images. Here is an example of how you can sample from an agent interacting
with the `libmypaint` environment:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import spiral.agents.default as default_agent
import spiral.agents.utils as agent_utils
import spiral.environments.libmypaint as libmypaint


# The path to a TF-Hub module.
MODULE_PATH = "https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/spiral/default-wgangp-celebahq64-gen-19steps/agent4/1"
# The folder containing `libmypaint` brushes.
BRUSHES_PATH = "the/path/to/libmypaint-brushes"

# Here, we create an environment.
env = libmypaint.LibMyPaint(episode_length=20,
                            canvas_width=64,
                            grid_width=32,
                            brush_type="classic/dry_brush",
                            brush_sizes=[1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24],
                            use_color=True,
                            use_pressure=True,
                            use_alpha=False,
                            background="white",
                            brushes_basedir=BRUSHES_PATH)


# Now we load the agent from a snapshot.
initial_state, step = agent_utils.get_module_wrappers(MODULE_PATH)

# Everything is ready for sampling.
state = initial_state()
noise_sample = np.random.normal(size=(10,)).astype(np.float32)

time_step = env.reset()
for t in range(19):
    time_step.observation["noise_sample"] = noise_sample
    action, state = step(time_step.step_type, time_step.observation, state)
    time_step = env.step(action)

# Show the sample.
plt.close("all")
plt.imshow(time_step.observation["canvas"], interpolation="nearest")
```

### Converting a trained agent into a TF-Hub module

```python
import spiral.agents.default as default_agent
import spiral.agents.utils as agent_utils
import spiral.environments.libmypaint as libmypaint


# This where we're going to put our TF-Hub module.
TARGET_PATH = ...
# A path to a checkpoint of the trained model.
CHECKPOINT_PATH = ...

# We will need to create an environment in order to obtain the specifications
# for the agent's action and the observation.
env = libmypaint.LibMyPaint(...)

# Here, we wrap a Sonnet module constructor for our agent in a function.
# This is to avoid contaminating the default tensorflow graph.
def agent_ctor():
  return default_agent.Agent(action_spec=env.action_spec(),
                             input_shape=(64, 64),
                             grid_shape=(32, 32),
                             action_order="libmypaint")

# Finally, export a TF-Hub module. We need to specify which checkpoint to use
# to extract the weights for the agent. Since the variable names in the
# checkpoint may differ from the names in the Sonnet module produced by
# `agent_ctor`, we may also want to provide an appropriate name mapping
# function.
agent_utils.export_hub_module(agent_ctor=agent_ctor,
                              observation_spec=env.observation_spec(),
                              noise_dim=10,
                              module_path=TARGET_PATH,
                              checkpoint_path=CHECKPOINT_PATH,
                              name_transform_fn=lambda name: ...)
```
